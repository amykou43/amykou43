[Amy Kou](https://github.com/amykou43/amykou43.git/) I am a fourth year Geography major here at UC Santa Barbara. I am from the Bay Area, San Jose to be specific. My hobbies include listening to music, jamming on the guitar, and going to the gym. 

With the coding skills I learned in R, I plan to use them to solve various problems and display data/spatial analysis. This will help me with geographic visualization of data that I will do in the field of GIS and to create maps.
